                    A director may resign from directorship or be removed by the shareholders by passing an ordinary resolution at a meeting of the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="text-dark">Resignation:</strong> Resigning as a company director is more than just giving notice. There are several additional considerations for both the director and the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="text-dark">Removal:</strong> Directors must act in accordance with their statutory and fiduciary duties, and in the best interests of the company for the benefit of the shareholders. Where the shareholders feel that a director is not performing his duties, they may wish to remove those directors. And, this process needs to comply with the requirements of the notice set out in the statue.

                </p>
                <p>
                    If a director is also a shareholder in the company, the act of ‘resignation’ from the directorship may require them to sell their shares in the company. In this case, there may be specific provisions listed down in the Articles of Association or a Shareholder’s agreement etc. on how they can offer their shares for sale. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can contact our Customer Service Desk to understand more about the provisions in this regard in the <strong class="text-dark"> Articles of Association or a Shareholder’s agreement</strong>.

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 mb-3">How does a director of a UK Company resign?</h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, a director should comply with the terms of their service agreement – Letter of appointment. A director should also comply with the provisions, if any, in the Articles of Association or a Shareholder’s agreement.  
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 mb-3">Notice of resignation should generally be given in writing.</h2>
                <p>
                    UK limited companies shall notify Companies House about certain changes in the company. These include the resignation of company directors. A company must do this within 14 days of the date of the director resigns form the office. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The company should also (1) update its register of directors (2) update its register of directors’ residential addresses (3) update its register of shareholders (in the case where the director was also a shareholder in the company, and sold their shares following his resignation), and (4) record the resignation in writing in the Minutes of the next board meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a sole individual director in a private limited company intends to resign form the office, then a replacement is required in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Failure to comply with those provisions can lead to ‘strike-off’ by Companies House. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 mb-3">
                    Public limited companies must have at least 2 directors at all times.
