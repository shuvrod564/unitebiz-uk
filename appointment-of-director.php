                    A UK private company limited must have at least one director, whereas a public limited company must have at least two. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The director(s) are legally responsible for running the company and they are dutybound to ensure the company accounts and reports are properly prepared.

                    A director of a UK Company must be 16 years old or over, and not be disqualified from being a director.

                    The director(s) of a company are appointed by the shareholders to manage the day-to-day affairs of the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The details of the director(s) declared at the company incorporation are mentioned in Companies House Form IN01 – the form used to apply to form a company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shareholders can appoint new director(s) any time after the company’s incorporation, and it needs to be notified to Companies House within 14 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to consider potential conflicts of interest when making appointment of director(s), as this is a key area of governance.
