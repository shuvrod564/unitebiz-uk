                    Yes, you can reserve your desired name for your company by registering it with Companies House. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with our regular company formation packages, we also provide the service of reserving the company name for you. It is perfect for customers who wish to book a company name for their business purposes in the immediate future, but are still not quite ready to trade yet (or a sole trader who has already been trading with that name for his sole proprietorship business, and that he wants to avoid any risk of losing the name to any other person – natural or a body corporate).
                </p>
                <p class="fw-bold text-dark">
                    So, here is how you reserve a name for a limited company - You form a limited company with that name!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you want to start a business in the United Kingdom, you have several options in terms of choosing the structure of the business entity you want to operate with – however, the most common options are (1) registering a limited company and (2) operate as a sole trader. The right model for you depends on the specific needs of your business.

                    What are the differences – UK Sole Trader vs. UK Limited Company
                </p>
                <p>
                    A sole trader is a self-employed person who owns and runs his own business as an individual. A sole trader business does not have any legal identity separate to its owner. As a sole trader, you have absolute control over your business, its assets and profits after tax. Besides this control, this ‘sole trader’ business model offers a lot of comparative simplicity, versatility and a number of other advantages over other entity structures. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    Unlike the owner (shareholder) of a limited company, a sole trader is personally liable for his business’s debts. Their personal assets may be at risk if creditors cannot be paid from the net assets of his business. This unlimited liability can pose significant challenges while operating as a sole trader. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    The most popular way to run a business in the UK is still being a sole trader. However, there are undeniable advantages of taking your business a step further and operating as a limited company. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    Navigating through the process of establishing a Limited Company involves a little more work than just registering as self-employed. Even though, the financial and statutory administrative duties involved in operating a limited company are relatively more, the additional work involved are worth the effort considering the several benefits of Limited Company status.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will be a significant move for a sole trader to go from being a self-employed to the director of your own company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A sole trader lacks limited liability protection so they will be held personally accountable for paying any debts incurred while running the sole-trader-business. Nevertheless, with a limited company you receive the protection of ‘limited liability’. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, with the protection of limited liability, any monetary setbacks will be settled by the company and not any individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Establishing a limited company prevents others from creating a company with the same or similar name. All companies in the UK must be registered with Companies House and all company names must be unique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sole traders need not register with Companies House and so their names are not available on Companies House register. Hence, there is not as much protection for names compared to that of a registered company. Nonetheless, sole traders have the choice to establish a limited company (to prevent others from setting up a limited company with their business name) and subsequently refrain from conducting any business through that company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is made possible by the fact that once a company has been established, you are not required to commence trading with it. You can keep it <a class="link d-inline fw-semibold" href="https://www.1stformations.co.uk/blog/what-is-a-dormant-company/">dormant</a> for as long as you wish - couple of months, a few years, or for indefinite period of time – entirely up to you.

                <p>
                    Using the correspondence details in the letter, you can write back to the HMRC notifying them that the company will be dormant until further notice.

                <p>
