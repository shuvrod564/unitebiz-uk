            <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">Post Incorporation Services</h2>
                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mb-3">Post Company Formation Services</h3>
                <p class="lead fw-bold">
                    What documents will I receive after the company formation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once Companies House approves the incorporation of the company, you will receive an email with copies of your company formation documents - these include the Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles of Association and Share Certificates for each member. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paper copies (if applicable) will be posted to you in the agreed timeframe.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mb-3">UTR Number for your UK Company</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the new company is incorporated in the UK, Companies House will notify HMRC who will issue your company with its unique tax reference number (UTR). You will need your UTR to register for Corporation Tax and all other matters including filing the company’s accounts, its tax return etc. and any payments that may be due in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The letter from HMRC containing details of your company’s UTR will be sent to the company’s registered address. The most convenient method is online registration for Corporation Tax using the activation code supplied by HMRC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, you may register for Corporation Tax within 3 months from the date of incorporation of the company by submitting the prescribed forms via mail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your new UK company will remain dormant for a period of time, you may choose not to register for Corporation Tax until your company begins trading. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, HMRC must be informed of this in writing as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please speak to our Customer Service Desk to know more information in this regard.

                <p class="lead fw-bold">Where should I keep my company registration documents?</p>
                <p>
                    Original hard copies shall be securely stored at your registered address. 
                </p>
                <p class="lead fw-bold">What if I make change to my company post incorporation?</p>
                <p>
                    If you make changes to your company after incorporation, you shall report the changes to Companies House & HMRC, as applicable, in the prescribed time. Directors can authorise most changes, however there are certain cases where the approval of the shareholders are required. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You shall report these changes to Companies House:
                </p>
                <ul class="disc__list">
                    <li class="mb-3">Change in Company Name</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Change in Registered Office</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Appointment and removal of directors & company secretary</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Most of these changes reported to the Companies House will also be updated on the public record.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the changes to your company need to be reported to HMRC – it includes (1) a new company name or trading address (2) any changes related to tax - eg: Corporation Tax, PAYE, VAT etc. (3) the closing down of your business etc.
                </p>
                <p class="lead fw-bold">How much does it cost to change company details?</p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mb-3">Confirmation Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    It is critical that certain information is reported accurately to Companies House, and for this reason the companies are required to submit a <strong>Confirmation Statement</strong> each year to verify the accuracy of the details held by Companies House. 
                </p>
                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">What company information is made public?</p>
                <p>
                    Most of the company information reported at Companies House is made available to the public. It includes:

                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">Where should I display the Company Name?</p>
                <p>
                    Your company name shall be displayed at the registered office, any other location where the business operates (with the exception of private residences), and all official documents and stationery (including letters, emails, websites, invoices, and promotional material).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please speak to our Customer Services Desk to understand how to display the company name if your UK company has been dormant since its incorporation. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">Business Bank Account for Non-UK Residents</h2>
                <p>
                    To assist new UK companies to get started with their business, we provide a fast track business bank account referral service. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are financial institutions – traditional banks as well as new generation digital banks – that we know would be interested in working with a company such as yours, based on the information we hold for you. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The approval of a new business banking account is entirely at the discretion of the financial institution, and subject to their own eligibility criteria.
                </p>
                <p class="lead fw-bold">Is it mandatory to operate a business bank account in the UK for my UK company?</p>
                <p>
                    You do not need a business bank account in the UK for your UK company, but it is recommended to have one. It simply makes it easier to manage finances of the UK Company as a separate legal entity by operating a designated business bank account.
                </p>
                <p class="lead fw-bold">Will a UK Business Account for Non-Resident include all the features I need?</p>
                <p>
                    All banks we may be able to offer you will include a Business Bank Account Number, Sort Code and Bank Card as well. 
                </p>
                <p class="lead fw-bold">Do you charge any additional fee for opening a Business Account?</p>
                <p>
                    We may or may not charge additional fee for this assistance – it depends on the package that you buy from us. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we also cannot guarantee that a bank will accept your application to open a business bank account. It is the discretion of the bank and it depends on many factors which are assessed on a company-to-company basis. 
                </p>
                <p class="lead fw-bold">Is it possible to open a UK Business Bank account for your company without visiting the UK? </p>
                <p>
                    Yes. It is possible. We work with different banks who is able to help non-residents open bank accounts in the UK without visiting the UK. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once your company is formed, we will match you with the most appropriate bank and send you the links to apply online. We will always send you more than one option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, it is the discretion of the bank to approve your application to open a business bank account.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">VAT Registration</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">Will I be registered automatically? </p>
                <p>
                    No. We will send you forms to complete so we can process your registration for PAYE and VAT.
                </p>

                <p class="lead fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Do I have to register for VAT?</p>
                <p>
                    No. <br>
                    You are legally required to register for VAT when you annual sales turnover is expected to cross £85000. Before this, you can choose to register for VAT if you want to on a Voluntary basis. The choice is yours. 
                    
                </p>

                <p class="lead fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">If I don’t claim my VAT registration immediately, can I claim it later?</p>
                <p>
                    Yes <br>
                    When you decide to register for VAT, you can complete the form you were sent and send it through to us. Once we have it we will know that you are ready to register for VAT and we will process your registration.  
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">PAYE Registration</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">Do I need to register for PAYE?</p>
                <p>
                    You need to register for PAYE when you employ UK based staff. Like with your VAT registration, you can claim this service from us when you are ready. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">Transfer of Shares</h2> 
                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mb-3">Issue of New Shares</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">How can I transfer shares or issue new shares after company formation?</p>
                <p>
                    After company formation, you are permitted to <a class="link d-inline" href="https://www.rapidformations.co.uk/transfer-of-shares/"> transfer shares </a>or increase your company's share capital by <a class="link d-inline" href="https://www.rapidformations.co.uk/issue-of-shares/"> issuing more shares</a>. These actions will require prior approval from either the directors or members, depending on what is stated in the articles of association, and you must inform Companies House when any such changes take place.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">Closing a company</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">How do I close my UK Company?</p>
                <p>
                    The way in which you <a class="link d-inline" href="https://www.rapidformations.co.uk/company-dissolution/"> close a company </a>depends on whether or not it can pay its bills. If the company is solvent, you can apply to Companies House to have it struck off the register, or you can start a members' voluntary liquidation. If the company is insolvent (bankrupt), you can close it by applying for a creditors' voluntary liquidation or compulsory liquidation.
                </p>
