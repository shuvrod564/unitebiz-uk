                <p>
                    In the UK, a registered office is a legal requirement for all companies registered at Companies House. It is the company’s official address and is publicly available for anyone to view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All companies incorporated in the UK are legally required to display the registered office address on business correspondence such as letters and the business website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The address can be different to that of your business / trading address. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies House, HMRC, and other government bodies will use your registered office address to deliver statutory letters and legal notices.

                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">Can a ‘Registered Office Address for a UK company’ be outside of the UK?</p>
                <p>
                    For a UK company, a registered office address cannot be outside of the UK.

                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">Director’s Service Address</h2>
                <p>
                    Director’s service address is an official address that all company directors need to have when they are appointed to a directorship of a UK company during or after incorporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A director of a UK company is required to provide a UK address which will appear on the public record where legal documents from Companies House and HMRC can be sent to them personally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only the service address will be made public and this was introduced in an effort to protect the privacy of company directors (the personal details of the directors need not be made public).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can provide you with a <strong>‘Director Service Address’</strong> if you wish to have a London address during the formation of the UK limited company. 
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mb-3">Protecting the Privacy of the Officers</h3>
                <p>
                    The new rules in the Companies Act states that all company officers (directors) must have 2 addresses registered with the registrar. These addresses are the private residential address of the director and the service address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rationale behind registering a service address is simple - It means that their private/home address and personal details would not be freely available to the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We provide this service to help you protect your personal details and maintain a professional edge to your business. You can simply register our address as your service address and we will forward all your statutory and official government correspondence to your preferred (personal/other) address.
                </p>

                    A service address is a legal requirement by HMRC and Companies House for statutory mails & correspondence for directors, whereas a Registered Office Address is the official address of the UK company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This registered office address must be located in the same area (jurisdiction) of the country where the company has been incorporated. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a company director, you can use your company’s registered office as your directors’ service address.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is perfectly okay to use the same address for both, as long as your premises complies with the legal requirements of a registered office.
                </p>

                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">Can you use a PO Box as a ‘Registered Office Address’ of a UK Company?</p>
                <p>
                    No. A registered office cannot use a PO Box as an official address. It has to be a proper postal address to be acceptable by HMRC and Companies House. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">Can you use a PO Box as a ‘Director’s Service Address’ for the incorporation of a UK Company?</p>
                <p>
                    Yes, you can use a PO Box as a director’s service address as long as you can provide a full postal address, including a post code. A PO Box Number is not acceptable.
                </p>
                
                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">What is a director’s role in the UK company?</p>
                <p>
                    Directors are legally responsible for running the company and making sure company accounts and reports are properly prepared.
                </p>
                
                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">How many directors are required to incorporate a UK limited company?</p>
                <p>
                    A minimum of one director is required to register a private company (although a public company needs two). There is no statutory upper limit to the number of directors a company appoints during or after formation, but there must always be at least one natural (human) company director. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    A director must be 16 or over and not be disqualified from being a director.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Shareholders own the company by owning its shares and are often referred to as 'members'. Directors on the other hand, manage the business and its operations. Unless the articles of association state so, a director isn't required to be a shareholder, and a shareholder has no legal right to be a director, neither has a legal responsibility to be a director.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Director does not have to necessarily live in the UK but companies must have a UK registered office address.

                <p>
                    A director of a UK Company must be 16 years old or over, and not be disqualified from being a director.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The director(s) of a company are appointed by the shareholders to manage the day-to-day affairs of the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The details of the director(s) declared at the company incorporation are mentioned in Companies House Form IN01 – the form used to apply to form a company.

                <h2 class="text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">Resignation of Director</h2>
                <p>
                    A director may resign from directorship or be removed by the shareholders by passing an ordinary resolution at a meeting of the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Resignation:</strong> Resigning as a company director is more than just giving notice. There are several additional considerations for both the director and the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Removal:</strong> Directors must act in accordance with their statutory and fiduciary duties, and in the best interests of the company for the benefit of the shareholders. Where the shareholders feel that a director is not performing his duties, they may wish to remove those directors. And, this process needs to comply with the requirements of the notice set out in the statue.

                    <strong>Issues to be considered by a director before resigning from the directorship of a UK Company:</strong> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a director is also a shareholder in the company, the act of ‘resignation’ from the directorship may require them to sell their shares in the company. In this case, there may be specific provisions listed down in the Articles of Association or a Shareholder’s agreement etc. on how they can offer their shares for sale. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can contact our Customer Service Desk to understand more about the provisions in this regard in the <strong> Articles of Association or a Shareholder’s agreement</strong>.

                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">How does a director of a UK Company resign?</p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, a director should comply with the terms of their service agreement – Letter of appointment. A director should also comply with the provisions, if any, in the Articles of Association or a Shareholder’s agreement.  
                </p>
                
                <p>Notice of resignation should generally be given in writing.</p>
                <p>
                    UK limited companies shall notify Companies House about certain changes in the company. These include the resignation of company directors. A company must do this within 14 days of the date of the director resigns form the office. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The company should also (1) update its register of directors (2) update its register of directors’ residential addresses (3) update its register of shareholders (in the case where the director was also a shareholder in the company, and sold their shares following his resignation), and (4) record the resignation in writing in the Minutes of the next board meeting.

                    If a sole individual director in a private limited company intends to resign form the office, then a replacement is required in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Failure to comply with those provisions can lead to ‘strike-off’ by Companies House. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Public limited companies must have at least 2 directors at all times.

                <p><strong>Shareholders</strong> are the people that own a company. They invest their money in the company by subscribing to the <strong>Shares</strong> of the company.</p>
                <p>
                    Both individuals and body corporates can be a shareholder in a company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The liabilities of the shareholder(s) are limited and the shareholders’ personal assets are protected from the company’s debts the in case of negative net worth of a limited company (LTDs or PLCs).
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Shareholders can appoint and remove directors, and can grant powers to the directors.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any person / body corporate can become a shareholder in a company after the formation of the company.  This is different to being a subscriber. A subscriber is the first member of the company, who details were added to the memorandum of association, and by doing so, they agreed to become part of the company. The name of the original subscriber(s) will remain on the Memorandum even if he/she transfers all the shares or even dies.
                </p>

                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">Can you be a shareholder and a company director?</p>
                <p>
                    Yes, the same person can have both roles. A shareholder can also be a director in the same company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shareholder is the owner of the company and has control over the directors who manages the day-to-day affairs of the company, and also entitled to proportionate share of dividends declared by the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Company directors are appointed to the Board specifically to manage all the day-to-day operations of the business. The objective is to protect the interests of the company as a whole as well as the shareholders.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mt-5 mb-3">Registration of the UK Company</h3>
                <p>
                    At the time of incorporation of the company, the first company directors are also appointed at the same time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The person or persons you nominate as directors are named in form IN01 and will then be deemed to have been appointed as your company's first directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All subsequent appointments through submission of form AP01, and new directors coming onboard will be governed by the company’s articles of association.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A director shall file a service address with Companies House as well as his/ her home address. It will be the service address that appears on the public record, and personal addresses will be kept private.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> A company director must also give general notice of any interests in any contracts held that involve the company. </p>
                <p>
                    You can speak to our Customer Services Desk to understand more about the regulations in this regard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a rule, new directors are given a copy of the company's memorandum and articles of association, and details of the business and affairs of the company, including board meeting minutes, and statutory report and accounts covering the past two years.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mt-5 mb-3">Duties of the Company Directors</h3>
                <p>
                    Directors are responsible for ensuring the statutory compliances by the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The general duties of the Director are -
                </p>
                <ul class="desc__list">
                    <li class="mb-3">Act within powers in accordance with the company’s constitution and to use those powers only for the purposes for which they were conferred</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Exercise independent judgement</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Avoid conflicts of interest</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Not to accept benefits from third parties</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Declare an interest in a proposed transaction or arrangement</li> 
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The directors have to ensure that the company maintains full and accurate accounting records. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the statutory responsibility of the director(s) to ensure the company accounts and the directors report are given to shareholders, as well as the subsequent filing of the accounts and the directors report with the Registrar of Companies at Companies House.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the company fails to comply with the statutory requirements, then the company director(s) may be liable to penalties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The liabilities that directors may incur for their acts or omissions in directing the company could result in personal liability, both civil and criminal – and can lead to disqualification of the directors.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mt-5 mb-3">Shareholders’ Agreements</h3>
                <p>
                    As the name implies, this is an agreement between the shareholders of a company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It sets out the terms agreed among the shareholders to protects the interests of those shareholders.
                </p>
                <p><span class="fst-italic fw-bold lead">Is there a standard template for Shareholders’ Agreements?</span></p>
                <p>
                    There is no such standard template for Shareholders’ Agreements, for the simple reason that any form of a ‘standard agreement’ will not cater to all of your company’s specific needs as well as the terms that you want to fix with your co-shareholders of the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A typical templet (standard version) is highly likely to lead to loopholes and voids in contracts and when you come to consult the agreement to resolve a dispute at a later stage. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Shareholders’ Agreements often contain standard clauses like – 
                </p>
                <ul class="disc__list">
                    <li class="mb-3">Restrictions and conditions on the transfer of shares. This enables you to keep control over who has an interest in your company.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Requirements for consent to be obtained from all shareholders (or all key shareholders in some cases) before any major decision is made.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Competition Clause: A restriction on shareholders acting in competition with the company once they cease to be a shareholder. </li> 
                </ul>
                <p>
                    One of the main objectives behind the Shareholders’ Agreements is that it enables a more efficient management of the company. It helps to avoid noises - You don’t want to be organizing a meeting over every little decision, but you need to have protection from the fellow shareholders if they take undue advantage of their authority over the company. Moreover, you want to make sure, when the time comes, that your company is an attractive place for a new investor wishing to invest in your company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not wise to keep the policies of your company wide open and making it vulnerable to different interpretations by different shareholders. Being too open in your policies is as good as making it ambiguous. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need to strike the right balance – which can only be determined by the unique nature of your company as well as the specific reason(s) that brought together the shareholders of the company to invest in the company. Hence, it is critical that you get a comprehensive Shareholders’ Agreement set in place to give y our business the best chance.

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">Private Limited Companies & Public Limited Companies</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">What is a private limited company?</p>
                <p>
                    Most of the companies in the UK are private limited companies – LTDs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are legal business forms with their own assets & liabilities. The ‘limited liability’ feature of these private companies protects its shareholders’ personal assets in any adverse business situations. The liabilities of the shareholders are limited to the value of their shares. Shares in private companies cannot be offered to the general public.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Private limited companies are incorporated with Companies House and are required to adopt legal documents - Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association at the time of incorporation of the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Private limited companies must have a minimum of one director (who must be a natural person). In most cases, the sole shareholder in the company will be director of the company. In his capacity as a company director, they have several statutory duties – one of the primary duties is to ensure the compliance of statutory requirements and ensure that an annual return is submitted to Companies house every year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Appointment of a Company Secretary is not mandatory for the private limited companies. 
                </p>

                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">What is a public limited company?</p>
                <p>
                    Public limited companies – PLCs - are similar to private limited companies in many aspects, mainly in the sense that they are legally distinct entities with their own assets & and liabilities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shares in a public company can be traded to the general public and their shares can be listed on a stock exchange. PLCs are the only type of company allowed to raise capital from this type of public investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Public limited companies are also incorporated with Companies House and are required to adopt legal documents - Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association at the time of incorporation of the company. Besides, they must comply with certain conditions in terms of minimum allotted share capital & paid-up share capital etc. which needs to be reflected in the Certificate of Commencement of Business, issued by Companies House.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PLCs must have at least 2 directors. And, a Company Secretary is also required by law.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">Company Secretary</h2>
                <p>
                    It is not necessary for a UK private limited company to appoint a Company Secretary. Some companies appoint Company Secretary to take on some of the responsibilities of the director(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Company Secretary can be a director in the same company; however, the Company Secretary cannot be (1) the auditor of the company (2) an ‘undischarged bankrupt’ unless they have secured special permission from the court of law. You can rely on the details in the Insolvency Register to check if someone has been ‘discharged’ - whether they are free from their debts and the restrictions placed on a person ended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No matter a company has a Company Secretary, the directors are legally responsible for the company.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 pt-lg-3 mb-3">Money Laundering Regulations</h2>
                <p>
                    It is important that all parties comply with all the relevant Money Laundering Regulations and KYC legislations.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p><strong>Bookkeeping requirements for Companies and LLPs incorporated in the UK</strong></p>
                <p>
                    HMRC requires all Companies and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) to keep accurate records of its business and its financial transactions for ensuring the compliance with tax & legal frameworks in the UK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The records must be kept for a minimum of 6 years from the end of the last financial year.  Failure to comply with the legal requirements of preserving the records can result in fines/penalties and the company directors can be disqualified for holding the office as a consequence. If the records are lost, stolen or accidentally destroyed, the company shall inform the legal authorities and restore the documentation to the best of its ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The company shall notify Companies House if the business changes its registered office address, directors' details or company secretary etc. A copy of the firm's annual return must also be submitted to Companies House within the prescribed period. Failures to comply with these regulations can cause serious consequences, including disqualification of director(s), personal prosecution and even company closure.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Once Companies House approves the incorporation of the company, you will receive an email with copies of your company formation documents - these include the Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles of Association and Share Certificates for each member. 
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    Once the new company is incorporated in the UK, Companies House will notify HMRC who will issue your company with its unique tax reference number (UTR). You will need your UTR to register for Corporation Tax and all other matters including filing the company’s accounts, its tax return etc. and any payments that may be due in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The letter from HMRC containing details of your company’s UTR will be sent to the company’s registered address. The most convenient method is online registration for Corporation Tax using the activation code supplied by HMRC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, you may register for Corporation Tax within 3 months from the date of incorporation of the company by submitting the prescribed forms via mail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your new UK company will remain dormant for a period of time, you may choose not to register for Corporation Tax until your company begins trading. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, HMRC must be informed of this in writing as soon as possible.

                    If you make changes to your company after incorporation, you shall report the changes to Companies House & HMRC, as applicable, in the prescribed time. Directors can authorise most changes, however there are certain cases where the approval of the shareholders are required.

                    You shall report these changes to Companies House:

                <p>
                    To assist new UK companies to get started with their business, we provide a fast track business bank account referral service. 
                </p>

                <p>

                </p>
                <p class="lead fw-bold">Is it mandatory to operate a business bank account in the UK for my UK company?</p>
                <p>
                    You do not need a business bank account in the UK for your UK company, but it is recommended to have one. It simply makes it easier to manage finances of the UK Company as a separate legal entity by operating a designated business bank account.
                </p>
                <p class="lead fw-bold">Will a UK Business Account for Non-Resident include all the features I need?</p>

                <p class="lead fw-bold">Do you charge any additional fee for opening a Business Account?</p>
                <p>
                    We may or may not charge additional fee for this assistance – it depends on the package that you buy from us. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we also cannot guarantee that a bank will accept your application to open a business bank account. It is the discretion of the bank and it depends on many factors which are assessed on a company-to-company basis. 
                </p>
                <p class="lead fw-bold">Is it possible to open a UK Business Bank account for your company without visiting the UK? </p>

                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-3">How do I close my UK Company?</p>
                <p>
                    The way in which you <a class="link d-inline" href="https://www.rapidformations.co.uk/company-dissolution/"> close a company </a>depends on whether or not it can pay its bills. If the company is solvent, you can apply to Companies House to have it struck off the register, or you can start a members' voluntary liquidation. If the company is insolvent (bankrupt), you can close it by applying for a creditors' voluntary liquidation or compulsory liquidation.
