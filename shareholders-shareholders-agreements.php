                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mb-3">Shareholders</h2>
                <p><strong class="text-dark">Shareholders</strong> are the people that own a company. They invest their money in the company by subscribing to the <strong class="text-dark">Shares</strong> of the company.</p>
                <p>
                    Both individuals and body corporates can be a shareholder in a company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The liabilities of the shareholder(s) are limited and the shareholders’ personal assets are protected from the company’s debts the in case of negative net worth of a limited company (LTDs or PLCs).
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Shareholders can appoint and remove directors, and can grant powers to the directors.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any person / body corporate can become a shareholder in a company after the formation of the company.  This is different to being a subscriber. A subscriber is the first member of the company, who details were added to the memorandum of association, and by doing so, they agreed to become part of the company. The name of the original subscriber(s) will remain on the Memorandum even if he/she transfers all the shares or even dies.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mt-5 mb-3">Can you be a shareholder and a company director?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, the same person can have both roles. A shareholder can also be a director in the same company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shareholder is the owner of the company and has control over the directors who manages the day-to-day affairs of the company, and also entitled to proportionate share of dividends declared by the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Company directors are appointed to the Board specifically to manage all the day-to-day operations of the business. The objective is to protect the interests of the company as a whole as well as the shareholders.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 mb-3">Registration of the UK Company</h2>
                <p>
                    At the time of incorporation of the company, the first company directors are also appointed at the same time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The person or persons you nominate as directors are named in form IN01 and will then be deemed to have been appointed as your company's first directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All subsequent appointments through submission of form AP01, and new directors coming onboard will be governed by the company’s articles of association.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A director shall file a service address with Companies House as well as his/ her home address. It will be the service address that appears on the public record, and personal addresses will be kept private.
                </p>
                <p><strong class="text-gray">Conflict of Interest:</strong> A company director must also give general notice of any interests in any contracts held that involve the company. </p>
                <p>
                    You can speak to our Customer Services Desk to understand more about the regulations in this regard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a rule, new directors are given a copy of the company's memorandum and articles of association, and details of the business and affairs of the company, including board meeting minutes, and statutory report and accounts covering the past two years.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 mb-3">Duties of the Company Directors</h2>
                <p>
                    Directors are responsible for ensuring the statutory compliances by the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The general duties of the Director are -
                </p>
                <ul class="disc__list">
                    <li class="mb-3">Act within powers in accordance with the company’s constitution and to use those powers only for the purposes for which they were conferred</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Exercise independent judgement</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Avoid conflicts of interest</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Not to accept benefits from third parties</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Declare an interest in a proposed transaction or arrangement</li> 
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The directors have to ensure that the company maintains full and accurate accounting records. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the statutory responsibility of the director(s) to ensure the company accounts and the directors report are given to shareholders, as well as the subsequent filing of the accounts and the directors report with the Registrar of Companies at Companies House.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the company fails to comply with the statutory requirements, then the company director(s) may be liable to penalties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The liabilities that directors may incur for their acts or omissions in directing the company could result in personal liability, both civil and criminal – and can lead to disqualification of the directors.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 mb-3">Shareholders’ Agreements</h2>
                <p>
                    As the name implies, this is an agreement between the shareholders of a company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It sets out the terms agreed among the shareholders to protects the interests of those shareholders.
                </p>
                <p><span class="fst-italic text-dark fw-bold lead">Is there a standard template for Shareholders’ Agreements?</span></p>
                <p>
                    There is no such standard template for Shareholders’ Agreements, for the simple reason that any form of a ‘standard agreement’ will not cater to all of your company’s specific needs as well as the terms that you want to fix with your co-shareholders of the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A typical templet (standard version) is highly likely to lead to loopholes and voids in contracts and when you come to consult the agreement to resolve a dispute at a later stage. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark fw-bold lead mb-3">
                    However, Shareholders’ Agreements often contain standard clauses like – 
                </p>
                <ul class="disc__list">
                    <li class="mb-3">Restrictions and conditions on the transfer of shares. This enables you to keep control over who has an interest in your company.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Requirements for consent to be obtained from all shareholders (or all key shareholders in some cases) before any major decision is made.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Competition Clause: A restriction on shareholders acting in competition with the company once they cease to be a shareholder. </li> 
                </ul>
                <p>
                    One of the main objectives behind the Shareholders’ Agreements is that it enables a more efficient management of the company. It helps to avoid noises - You don’t want to be organizing a meeting over every little decision, but you need to have protection from the fellow shareholders if they take undue advantage of their authority over the company. Moreover, you want to make sure, when the time comes, that your company is an attractive place for a new investor wishing to invest in your company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not wise to keep the policies of your company wide open and making it vulnerable to different interpretations by different shareholders. Being too open in your policies is as good as making it ambiguous. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need to strike the right balance – which can only be determined by the unique nature of your company as well as the specific reason(s) that brought together the shareholders of the company to invest in the company. Hence, it is critical that you get a comprehensive Shareholders’ Agreement set in place to give y our business the best chance.
