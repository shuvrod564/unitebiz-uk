                <p>
                    HMRC requires all Companies and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) to keep accurate records of its business and its financial transactions for ensuring the compliance with tax & legal frameworks in the UK.

                <p>
                    The records must be kept for a minimum of 6 years from the end of the last financial year.  Failure to comply with the legal requirements of preserving the records can result in fines/penalties and the company directors can be disqualified for holding the office as a consequence. If the records are lost, stolen or accidentally destroyed, the company shall inform the legal authorities and restore the documentation to the best of its ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The company shall notify Companies House if the business changes its registered office address, directors' details or company secretary etc. A copy of the firm's annual return must also be submitted to Companies House within the prescribed period. Failures to comply with these regulations can cause serious consequences, including disqualification of director(s), personal prosecution and even company closure.
