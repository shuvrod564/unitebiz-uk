                    Director’s service address is an official address that all company directors need to have when they are appointed to a directorship of a UK company during or after incorporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A director of a UK company is required to provide a UK address which will appear on the public record where legal documents from Companies House and HMRC can be sent to them personally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only the service address will be made public and this was introduced in an effort to protect the privacy of company directors (the personal details of the directors need not be made public).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can provide you with a <strong class="text-dark">‘Director Service Address’</strong> if you wish to have a London address during the formation of the UK limited company. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary mt-5 mb-3">Protecting the Privacy of the Officers</h2>
                <p>
                    The new rules in the Companies Act states that all company officers (directors) must have 2 addresses registered with the registrar. These addresses are the private residential address of the director and the service address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rationale behind registering a service address is simple - It means that their private/home address and personal details would not be freely available to the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We provide this service to help you protect your personal details and maintain a professional edge to your business. You can simply register our address as your service address and we will forward all your statutory and official government correspondence to your preferred (personal/other) address.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mt-5 mb-3">Is there a difference between ‘a Director Service Address’ and ‘a Registered Office Address’?</h3>
                <p>
                    A service address is a legal requirement by HMRC and Companies House for statutory mails & correspondence for directors, whereas a Registered Office Address is the official address of the UK company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This registered office address must be located in the same area (jurisdiction) of the country where the company has been incorporated. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a company director, you can use your company’s registered office as your directors’ service address.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is perfectly okay to use the same address for both, as long as your premises complies with the legal requirements of a registered office.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mt-5 mb-3">Can you use a PO Box as a ‘Registered Office Address’ of a UK Company?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. A registered office cannot use a PO Box as an official address. It has to be a proper postal address to be acceptable by HMRC and Companies House. 
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mt-5 mb-3">Can you use a PO Box as a ‘Director’s Service Address’ for the incorporation of a UK Company?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, you can use a PO Box as a director’s service address as long as you can provide a full postal address, including a post code. A PO Box Number is not acceptable.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mt-5 mb-3">What is a director’s role in the UK company?</h3>
                <p>
                    Directors are legally responsible for running the company and making sure company accounts and reports are properly prepared.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="h3 text-gray mt-5 mb-3">How many directors are required to incorporate a UK limited company?</h3>
                <p>
                    A minimum of one director is required to register a private company (although a public company needs two). There is no statutory upper limit to the number of directors a company appoints during or after formation, but there must always be at least one natural (human) company director. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    A director must be 16 or over and not be disqualified from being a director.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Shareholders own the company by owning its shares and are often referred to as 'members'. Directors on the other hand, manage the business and its operations. Unless the articles of association state so, a director isn't required to be a shareholder, and a shareholder has no legal right to be a director, neither has a legal responsibility to be a director.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Director does not have to necessarily live in the UK but companies must have a UK registered office address. 
                </p>
