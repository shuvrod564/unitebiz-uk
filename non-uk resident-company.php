                    A non-resident can register a UK company as you are not required to be a UK resident to register a limited company with Companies House. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can get a limited company registered in the UK from any country, say USA, UAE, India, Hong Kong etc. and we can help you complete the registration of the company in a few hours. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For establishing a company in the UK, there is no restriction with regard to your country of domicile or nationality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many UK limited companies start as ‘owner-managed’. In this case, you can be both the shareholder and director in the company.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only thing you need to register a UK company is a UK-registered office address. You can avail our UK Registered Office Address service for this purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application for registration of a UK Company can be submitted online with Companies House. 
                </p>
