                    Are you prepared to launch your promising business concept in the market? The initial stage involves gathering the necessary details to register a company in the United Kingdom. This process entails selecting a business structure and formalizing the operational aspects of your company. Begin by reviewing Step 1 to commence your journey in understanding the process of company registration in the UK.

                <h2 class="h3 mb-3 mt-5 text-gray">Select a business entity type</h2> 
                <p>
                    The majority of entrepreneurs who register a company in the UK typically choose a 'private company limited by shares.' 
                    This business structure can serve as an efficient tax management strategy. For example, as a company director, you have the option to receive a portion of your income in the form of company dividends, resulting in reduced income tax liability. Additionally, the concept of 'limited liability' ensures that your personal assets, such as your home and vehicle, should remain safeguarded in the event of financial difficulties faced by the company.
