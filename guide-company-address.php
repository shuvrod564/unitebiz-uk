                <p>
                    A Registered Office Address is a legal requirement. A Central London Registered Adress can enhance the image of your company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Officer’s Service Address is also a legal requirement. A service address, other than the private/home address protects the privacy of the officer. This service address is the address that will be made available to the public. While the residential address will still need to be provided, it will only be available to certain public authorities – HMRC etc.
